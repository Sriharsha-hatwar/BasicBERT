# BasicBERT: Metaphor Detection via Explicit Basic Meanings Modelling

This repository contains the implementation of our ACL 2023 paper "Metaphor Detection via Explicit Basic Meanings Modelling" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17268.pdf). 

BasicBERT is a novel metaphor identification mechanism that leverages the Metaphor Identification Process (MIP) via direct basic meaning modelling of targets. The core idea behind BasicBERT is to compare the contextual meaning of a word with its basic meaning to identify metaphorical usages. This approach significantly improves the metaphor detection performance, as demonstrated in our paper.

## Run

We're preparing our code and pre-trained models. Will be ready soon. In the mean time, you could check out our work at [EACL 2023](https://github.com/liyucheng09/MetaphorFrame), where we provide a ready-to-use model that can be easily applied on your own data.
