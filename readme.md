# BasicBERT: Metaphor Detection via Explicit Basic Meanings Modelling

This repository contains the implementation for the final project of the course COMPSCI 685 - Advanced NLP. This repository is the extension of the work from the ACL 2023 paper "Metaphor Detection via Explicit Basic Meanings Modelling" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17268.pdf). 

This paper uses two concepts of MIP (Metaphor Identification Process) and SPV (Selectional preference violation) for identifying metaphor 

We propose extension of this project by in two direction : 

1. Utlize GPT 3.5 for improving the MIP representation 

2. Design a new way to represent SPV. 


## Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

DataCollection/: Contains the script used for extending data and also contains dataset created using GPT3.5.
utils/: Utility functions and scripts for data processing and model evaluation.
results/: Directory for storing evaluation results and metrics.
