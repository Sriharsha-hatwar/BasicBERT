16177,0,1,"Although the major theoretical explanations are covered in the numerous introductions to the sociology of crime and deviance and to sociology generally , some review of these theories is necessary before embarking upon an examination of specific , substantive examples of criminal behaviour .",34
16210,1,0,"It would be naive to expect to uncover any ultimate explanation or basic cause for criminal behaviour , given the extensive and diverse behaviour that is encompassed by the term crime .",26

16251,1,0,"Clearly , we are getting further and further away from the causes of delinquent behaviour , and it is perhaps wisest to think in terms of causal processes when looking at criminal behaviour .",0
